REST Architectural Constraints

Link: [REST Constraints](https://restfulapi.net/rest-architectural-constraints/)
* REST stands for Representational State Transfer, a term coined by Roy Fielding in 2000.
  * It is an architecture style for designing loosely coupled applications over HTTP
  * REST does not enforce any rule regarding how it should be implemented at lower level
    * it just put high level design guidelines and leave you to think of your own implementation.

> The writer of the link designed RESTful APIs for telecom major company for 2 good years.
In this post, he shared his thoughts apart from normal design practices.
You may not agree with him on a few points, and he said that’s perfectly OK.
He will be happy to discuss anything from you with an open mind.
