## Summary

You've adopted a pet and have no idea what to name to give your new family member. You decide to take suggestions from the internet. After waiting a day, the suggestions have exploded and you have a very long list of names, some of the names repeated multiple times.

Write an algorithm that will take the array of strings and output another array of unique names.

## Input

An array of strings

## Output

An array of strings without repeated strings

## Example

```
Example 1
Input:
["Bob", "Ross", "Guy", "Taco", "Waffles", "Ross", "Felix", "Felix", "Waffles"]

Output:
["Bob", "Ross", "Guy", "Taco", "Waffles", "Felix"]

Example 2
Input:
["Taco", "Taco", "Taco", "Felix", "Taco", "Burrito", "Pino"]

Output:
["Taco", "Felix", "Burrito", "Pina"]
```
## Constraints

You cannot use Sets.

## Tips

Try to get it to O(n) time complexity!
